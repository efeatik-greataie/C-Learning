# C Learning

This is a project that I am using to document my C learning experience with the CS50 course on YouTube and other supplementary sources.

I am using the NeoVim editor to code and GCC to compile my programs.
I also do every workflow in the MacOS, Linux and Windows terminal to gain a better understanding of computing in general and to build muscle memory.
